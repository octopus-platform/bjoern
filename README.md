# Bjoern: a platform for graph-based analysis of binary code

Bjoern is a platform for the analysis of binary code. The platform
ports, extends, and reimplements concepts of the source code analysis
platform joern. It generates a graph representation of native code
directly from output provided by the open-source reverse engineering
toolchain radare2, and stores it in an OrientDB graph database for
subsequent mining with graph database queries.

You can find its documentation here:
